>### TLDR
>
>The executive order creates a new "Schedule Policy/Career" classification for federal employees in policy-influencing positions, making it easier to remove them from their roles and reducing traditional civil service protections. While employees don't need to personally support administration policies, they must implement them or face dismissal. This could affect thousands of career civil servants and potentially increase political influence in traditionally nonpartisan positions.

------

This executive order focuses on restructuring federal workforce accountability, particularly for policy-influencing positions.

### Key Components

Schedule policy/career creation:

- Reinstates and modifies Executive Order 13957 from 2020, renaming "Schedule F" to "Schedule Policy/Career"
- Creates a new classification for federal employees in policy-influencing positions
- Removes these positions from standard civil service protections and competitive service procedures

Accountability measures:

- Cites that only 41% of civil service supervisors feel confident in removing insubordinate employees
- Notes even lower confidence (26%) in removing poor performers
- Implements easier removal procedures for employees in policy-influencing positions

Implementation requirements:

- Orders the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to rescind the April 9, 2024 rule on "Upholding Civil Service Protections"
- Requires OPM to issue guidance within 30 days about additional position categories for Schedule Policy/Career consideration
- Revokes Executive Order 14003 (Protecting the Federal Workforce) from January 22, 2021

Potential impact:

- Significantly reduces job security for federal employees in policy roles
- Could affect thousands of career civil servants across federal agencies
- May lead to increased political influence over traditionally nonpartisan positions

Controversial aspects:

- Creates a dual standard within federal workforce
- While claiming to maintain merit-based principles, it reduces traditional civil service protections
- Could potentially enable easier removal of career officials who disagree with administration policies

Key provision:

The order explicitly states that employees don't need to personally support the president or administration policies, but must "faithfully implement" them or face dismissal

### Implementation Challenges

Administrative hurdles:

- Requires significant regulatory changes
- Necessitates agency-by-agency review of positions
- May face legal challenges from federal employee unions

Operational concerns:

- Could lead to increased turnover in key policy positions
- May affect institutional knowledge retention
- Potential impact on agency effectiveness during transitions

This executive order represents a significant shift in federal workforce management, prioritizing political responsiveness over traditional civil service protections, with potentially far-reaching implications for government operations and policy implementation.

### LITIGATION

After this EO was signed, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), a government union that represents workers from 37 agencies, [filed a lawsuit](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/vTRUMPetalDocketNo125cv00170DDCJan202025CourtDocket?doc_id=X7TF4FQELTE9RHPU7IMV7V9L1KQ) in the against the Trump administration to reverse the order. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, argues that the EO is "contrary to congressional intent."

------

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301, 3302, and 7511 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows

Section 1.

Purpose.

Article II of the United States Constitution vests the President with the sole and exclusive authority over the executive branch, including the authority to manage the Federal workforce to ensure effective execution of Federal law. A critical aspect of this executive function is the responsibility to maintain professionalism and accountability within the civil service. This accountability is sorely lacking today. Only 41 percent of civil service supervisors are confident that they can remove an employee who engaged in insubordination or serious misconduct. Even fewer supervisors –- 26 percent — are confident that they can remove an employee for poor performance.

Accountability is essential for all Federal employees, but it is especially important for those who are in policy-influencing positions. These personnel are entrusted to shape and implement actions that have a significant impact on all Americans. Any power they have is delegated by the President, and they must be accountable to the President, who is the only member of the executive branch, other than the Vice President, elected and directly accountable to the American people. In recent years, however, there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career Federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership. Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.

Sec. 2.

Reinstatement of Prior Administration Policy.

Executive Order 13957 of October 21, 2020 (Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service), is hereby immediately reinstated with full force and effect, subject to the amendments described in section 3 of this order; provided that the date of this order shall be treated as the date of Executive Order 13957.

Sec. 3.

Amendments to Prior Administration Policy.

Executive Order 13957 is amended as follows:

(a) replace the letter “F” throughout, when used to designate an excepted service schedule, with the words “Policy/Career”;

(b) in section 1:

(i) remove the text between the words “make necessary” in the seventh paragraph and “excepting such positions” in the eighth paragraph; and

(ii) insert the text “competitive service and the” immediately before the words “adverse action procedures” in the eighth paragraph;

(c) in section 4(a)(i), replace the word “Positions” with the words “Career positions” in the final paragraph;

(d) in section 4(b)(i), add the text “providing for the application of Civil Service Rule 6.3(a) to Schedule Policy/Career positions and” after the words “as appropriate”;

(e) in section 5:

(i) insert the words “recommend that the President” immediately after the words “petition the Director to” in subsection (a)(i);

(ii) insert the following text at the end of subsection (c):

“(vi) directly or indirectly supervising employees in Schedule Policy/Career positions; or

(vii) duties that the Director otherwise indicates may be appropriate for inclusion in Schedule Policy/Career.”; and

(iii) amend subsection (d) to read “The Director shall promptly recommend to the President which positions should be placed in Schedule Policy/Career.”;

(f) in section 6:

(i) designate the existing text as new subsection
“(a)”;

(ii) insert a new subsection (b) that reads:

“(b) Employees in or applicants for Schedule Policy/Career positions are not required to personally or politically support the current President or the policies of the current administration. They are required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the President. Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal.”

Sec. 4.

Conforming Regulatory Changes.

The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (Director) shall promptly amend the Civil Service Regulations to rescind all changes made by the final rule of April 9, 2024, “Upholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles,” 89 _Fed. Reg._ 24982, that impede the purposes of or would otherwise affect the implementation of Executive Order 13957. Until such rescissions are effectuated (including the resolution of any judicial review), 5 CFR part 302, subpart F, 5 CFR 210.102(b)(3), and 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4) shall be held inoperative and without effect.

Sec. 5.

The heads of each executive department and agency shall review and identify existing agency actions relating to or arising under section 3(e)(v) and 3(f) of Executive Order 14003 (relating to suspending, revising, or rescinding revisions to discipline and unacceptable performance policies) and, as soon as practicable, suspend, revise, or rescind such actions identified in the review.

Sec. 7.

General Provisions.

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or

THE WHITE HOUSE,

January 20, 2025.
